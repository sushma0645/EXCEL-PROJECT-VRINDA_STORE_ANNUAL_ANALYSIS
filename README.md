# EXCEL-PROJECT-VRINDA_STORE_ANNUAL_ANALYSIS


**Objective: Vrinda Stores aims to create an annual sales report for 2022 to understand their customers better and drive sales growth through 2023.**

During the creation of this dashboard, I acquired a diverse set of skills, including:
- Analyzing and cleaning data
- Using Excel formulas and functions to work with data
- Making pivot tables
- Designing the dashboard's look
- Formatting slicers.

**Key Insights:**

* The data reveals a striking truth: women are the driving force behind our sales, with a substantial ~65% share.
* The top-performing states are Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, together contributing a remarkable ~35% to the overall sales.
* Young adults within the age group of 30 to 49 were the most significant contributors, accounting for about 50% of the total sales.
* Major sales contributions came from channels like Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra, with an impressive 80% impact.
* April noted the highest number of sales.
* The greatest number of sales were placed via Amazon (35%).
* 92% of the orders were successfully delivered.

**Crafting Success:**
The store must prioritize targeting female customers of the age group (30-49 years) residing in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh by utilizing advertisements, coupons and discounts, offers, and other value-added services available on Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart.
